Misc Arm Assembly Source
=========================

What is this?
--------------
Just sharing the exercises I've done to
learn something about the Arm's ISA

Language
---------
I used the GAS syntax due to compile it with as (gcc linaro)

Tools
-----
I've compiled and run all the code on ubuntu 11.10, gcc 4.8 linaro on a Freescale i.mx6 quad
